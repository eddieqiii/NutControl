NutControl
=========
An Android app to control bluetooth serial devices.
# What does it do??
Right now, this app connects to a bluetooth serial device (previously paired) and sends ASCII-encoded integers from 0-65535 from a SeekBar, followed by a semicolon (no newline):
```
(int);
```
# Why?
All of the other Bluetooth serial control apps available on the Play Store seemed shifty, and were designed for extremely specific use cases. (so is this)
# This code is terrible
yeah soz
# Will you update this??
Maybe
# How do I run it?
